# Java-Trainagle_Patterns
\This Java program prints a centered triangle pattern based on user input  𝑛 n. It uses loops to format spaces, print ascending numbers from 1 to  𝑖 i, and then descending numbers for symmetry. The outer loop controls rows, while inner loops handle spaces and numbers. It demonstrates nested loops for structured pattern printing in Java.
